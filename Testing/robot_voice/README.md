# robot_voice

Simple Python program that takes a .wav recording of a voice and adds a 'robot' voice effect.  Features a numpy implementation of a ring modulator emulator.  A ring modulator was used to create the 'Dalek voice' in the original Dr. Who series; I've translated the BBC's Javascript implementation (http://webaudio.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/ring-modulator/) into Python.  Thanks, BBC!
